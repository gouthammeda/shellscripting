#!/bin/bash

#-sharp(like in c#)
#!- symbol bang because usually bang word ends with !
#sharp+bang -> shabang or shebang both are same
#we can say /bin/bash understandingShabang.sh which means interpreter is called to execute the script. 
#so shabang with bin/bash is used inside the script without needing to call interpreter each time we run the script. 

# if we use the rm interpreter then script will be deleted.
# we can also use the sh interpreter to run the script.
