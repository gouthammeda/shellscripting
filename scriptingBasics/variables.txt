we have 3 ways to assign a value to variable.

Explicit definition: VAR=value 
Read command: read VAR 
Command substitution: VAR=$(pwd)

VAR=value -> no spaces between '='.

It is better to have variable names with capital letters.
COUNT=5
PATH=/var/lib
DOGS_NUMBER = 8--> doesn't work as bash thinks we are passing arguments to dogs_number.

MESSAGE=hello
MESSAGE=hello buddy
MESSAGE="hello buddy"--> if we want to store senetence then we have to enclose them with quotes.

accessing variable 
echo $COUNT
echo $PATH 
echo "path=$PATH"
